Included in the rest of this file is the war file that was uploaded to the EC2 instance for the student survey part of this assignment along with the html and css files. 

Please unzip the project folder and open the folder in Eclipse Enterprise Edition. You may view the source code on the Eclipse IDE. For the student survey form, the html and css files will be under the web content folders. 

You may also add this project to your tomcat server through eclipse and launch it on your tomcat local host address. 

Please let me know if anything else is required on my end. 

Thank you!
